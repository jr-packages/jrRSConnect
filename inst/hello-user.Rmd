# Hello, `r params$user`

This is a most basic example or an R markdown document with
a parameter. The document is updated upon deployment, or
when a publisher modifies the parameter using the Connect
user interface.  A later example will show you how to
access a real username within a running Shiny application.

The two parameters configurable for this document (with
current values) are:

    user = `r params$user`
    x = `r params$x`

```{r}
# R code can be executed in these blocks as normal
x2 = params$x * params$x
```

These can be used anywhere in the markdown document. The
value of $x$ is $`r params$x`$ and the value of $x^2$ is
$`r x2`$.

Thank you for visiting this document, `r params$user`.
